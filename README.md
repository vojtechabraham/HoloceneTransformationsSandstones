code for Figure 3 in paper Novák J, Abraham V, Šída P and Pokorný P (2019) Holocene forest transformations in sandstone landscapes of the Czech Republic: Stand-scale comparison of charcoal and pollen records. The Holocene 29(9): 1468–1479: doi:10.1177/0959683619854510.

Inspiration for our Figure 3 was Figure 3 in: Bobek P, Svobodová HS, Werchan B, Švarcová MG and Kuneš P (2017) Human-induced changes in fire regime and subsequent alteration of the sandstone landscape of Northern Bohemia (Czech Republic): The Holocene 28(3): 427–443: doi:10.1177/0959683617729443.

Attached data of the species composition do not correspond with the paper due to restictions of the original data. This is just a template for Figure 3.
